Module 11; note taking application

When the application is started, the user is greeted with an index.html file with a button to prompt them into starting the app.

Once clicked, the notes.html file is populated. This screen contains a text input field to write a note with a title. Once the text is input, a save button appears in the top right corner, and the saved note(s) appear in a column to the left. 

The user is able to click on previous notes, and they are brought back into the main text field to view. Data persists on screen refresh.
